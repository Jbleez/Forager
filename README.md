# Forager
Forager is a web-based application used for finding errors on Southern Polytechnic State University’s website. It crawls over all the pages on the spsu.edu domain and searches for errors like broken links to other web pages or content like videos and pictures.  It compiles a list of all the errors it finds and displays them in an interface so that it’s simple to see what pages have errors, how many errors, and the types of errors
